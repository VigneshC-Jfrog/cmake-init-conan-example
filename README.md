# cmake-init + Conan

This is an example repository showcasing [Conan][1] integration with
[cmake-init][2] generated projects.

The list of changes to make when integrating with Conan:

* Add a [conanfile][3] that lists the dependencies and the generators to use
* Add a `conan` preset to [`CMakePresets.json`](CMakePresets.json#L25), which
  uses the toolchain generated by the `CMakeToolchain` generator that enables
  CMake to find config files generated by the `CMakeDeps` generator
* Inherit from the above preset in your [CI](CMakePresets.json#L84) and [dev
  presets](HACKING.md#L44)
* Mention in [`HACKING.md`](HACKING.md#L80) that the project uses Conan
* Mention in [`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md#L3) what the dependencies are of the
  project and that acquiring them via Conan is an option
* Install Conan in the [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml#L12-L19) workflow and the
  dependencies

Every other change in the repository was made just to make this repository more
focused on showing how to integrate with Conan, like removing unused presets
and trimming the CI workflow yaml.
